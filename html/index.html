        <h3>In last year i was with my friends in Amsterdam, this is my second time there but the first one at spring season, at the first time i visited there with my wife in the winter<br>
        it was lovely to be there in the spring, the weather is more nice for walking and exploring the city by foot, you get to see some beatiful buildings and gardens that you see only by "mistake".</h3><br>

        <p>In the first day we went to the ZOO and it was very beatiful and funny experience, after the ZOO we went eating at Burger King and at night went to a pub under our AirBnb apartment.<br><br>
        on the second day we went to Van Gough Museum and it was amazing, he was an amazing artist and to see all of is art work is breathtaking, after that we at lunch at HardRock caffe near to the cannal, it was a sunny pleasant day<br><br>
    on the third day we ate breakfast at Picnic caffe, they have very good eggs and baycon dish, and then we visited at the Vondle Park and its HUGE park, with many spots to just seat and relaxe, enjoy the nature and see all those green trees.<br><br>

the 4th day was our last day so we wake up in the morning, went for a breakfast and start package al our stuff back to the suitcase and from there to the airport back to Israel.</p><br><br>
